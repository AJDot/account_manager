## Blog Entries
This repository is used to demonstrate (mostly for myself) how to get started with Ruby on Rails.

## Todo

1. Before Actions
2. Each holder can only see their accounts. Admin user can see everyone's accounts.
3. Need registration/login, security (password_digest)
3. Holders can see all information on account and can make transactions (deposit & withdrawal to start).

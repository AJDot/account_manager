# Account Manager

## Blog Entries
This repository is used to demonstrate (mostly for myself) how to get started with Ruby on Rails.
[Blog Entry #1](https://medium.com/@alex.henegar/ruby-on-rails-entry-1-database-setup-42918abbb88a)


## Todo

1. Write second blog post. Includes writing views to display information and controllers to handle the routes.
2. Each holder can only see their accounts. Admin user can see everyone's accounts.
3. Holders can see all information on account and can make transactions (deposit & withdrawal to start).
4. Make the routes for accounts
5. Make controller for accounts
